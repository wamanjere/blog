# blog
learning python with this simple blogging app with oop
the blogging app has create_post that once the post has been created with title and post, the save_to_json is called to save to a local directory.
the blogging app also supports the rest of the CRUD operations search as read_post, update_post and delete_post. i have also integrated a feature to search for posts using available titles or keywords 
in the content area. you can also view all the posts in the program. the blogging app is purely for learning but could be improved even further.  feel free to correct ne as am still new to python programming
